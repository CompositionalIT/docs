## Social
You can also reach out to the SAFE team on [@safe_stack](https://twitter.com/safe_stack) or on the regular F# channels on Slack: either the official [F# Foundation Slack](https://fsharp.org/guides/slack/) (an F# Foundation membership is required) or on the [Functional Programming Slack](https://functionalprogramming.slack.com/messages/C045LHLTH/). We'll be expanding this over time.
